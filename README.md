This is a simple mod that initially started as an addition for some features not implemented by the KJS community. It currently implements some basic item rendering, which can be considered a simple extension to[RenderJS](https://github.com/ch1335/RenderJS). And an Item type that can be used to create [MEK Module Item](https://wiki.aidancbrady.com/wiki/Modules)

### TODE LIST
- [x] Add support for customized rendering of `Item`
- [x] Add an Item type that can be used to create [MEK Module Item](https://wiki.aidancbrady.com/wiki/Modules)
- [x] Add registration of additional models
- [ ] ...(still being improved)

### Attention
<span style="color: red;">
This version has been modified a lot from its predecessor, the rendering part has been moved from the item registration part to the use of event registration, as you can see in the example.
